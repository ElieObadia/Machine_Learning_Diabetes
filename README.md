# Machine Learning Diabetes
This project aims to use machine learning techniques to predict the onset of diabetes in patients. The dataset used for this project is [Diabetes 130-US hospitals for years 1999-2008 Data Set](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Diabetes+130-US+hospitals+for+years+1999-2008).

The project is implemented in Python, using the scikit-learn library for building and evaluating the machine learning models. The models used in this project include logistic regression, k-nearest neighbors, and decision trees.

To use the project, simply clone the repository and run the Jupyter notebook. The notebook contains the code for loading the dataset, preprocessing the data, and training and evaluating the models. The results of the model evaluation can be found in the notebook.
